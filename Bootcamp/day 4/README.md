DAY 4:
This repository contains implementations of linear regression models, including simple and multiple regression, data visualization, model assessment, and feature impact analysis.

1. Basic Linear Regression
Implemented a simple linear regression model using one predictor to predict an outcome.

Challenges Faced:
Understanding how to fit a regression model with one feature.

Interpreting the coefficients and predictions.
What I Learned:
How to implement simple linear regression.
The significance of the slope and intercept in regression.

2. Data Visualization for Regression
Plotted the dataset and the regression line to visually interpret the model fit.

Challenges Faced:
Choosing an appropriate visualization method.
Ensuring the regression line accurately represents the data trend.

What I Learned:
How to use scatter plots and regression lines for analysis.
The importance of visualizing data to understand model performance.

3. Multiple Linear Regression
Built a multiple linear regression model using multiple features to predict an outcome.

Challenges Faced:
Handling multicollinearity between features.
Understanding how additional features influence predictions.

What I Learned:
How to implement multiple linear regression.
The impact of feature selection on model performance.

4. Model Assessment
Evaluated the regression model using R-squared and RMSE metrics.

Challenges Faced:
Understanding how to interpret R-squared and RMSE values.
Analyzing whether the model is overfitting or underfitting.

What I Learned:
The importance of model evaluation metrics.
How R-squared measures goodness of fit and RMSE quantifies error.

5. Feature Impact Analysis
Analyzed the impact of each feature on the modelâ€™s prediction using coefficient analysis.

Challenges Faced:
Understanding how coefficients reflect feature importance.
Identifying which features contribute most to the prediction.

What I Learned:
How to analyze feature importance using regression coefficients.
The effect of different features on the overall prediction.
