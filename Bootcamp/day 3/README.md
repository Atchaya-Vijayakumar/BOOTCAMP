DAY 3 :

This repository contains Python implementations of key OOP concepts, including class creation, constructors, inheritance, multiple inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

1. Class Creation
Created a Dog class with attributes (name, age) and methods (bark() and sleep()).

Challenges Faced:
Understanding how to define a class and use methods correctly.
Deciding what attributes and methods a basic class should have.

What I Learned:
How to create a class in Python.
How to define attributes and methods.

2. Constructor Use
Used the __init__ constructor to initialize attributes in the Dog class.

Challenges Faced:
Initially forgot to use self when assigning attributes.
Confusion about why __init__ is necessary.

What I Learned:
The importance of constructors in object initialization.
How to use self to access instance attributes.

3. Inheritance
Created a Puppy class that inherits from Dog and adds a play() method.

Challenges Faced:
Understanding how to inherit methods from the parent class.
Managing attribute initialization in subclasses.

What I Learned:
How to implement inheritance in Python.
How child classes can extend parent classes.

4. Multiple Inheritance
Created a Hybrid class that inherits from both Dog and Cat classes.

Challenges Faced:
Understanding how multiple inheritance works.
Handling method conflicts from multiple parent classes.

What I Learned:
How Python resolves method resolution order (MRO).
The risks of ambiguity in multiple inheritance.

5. Encapsulation
Implemented private (__energy_level) and protected (_model) attributes in a Robot class.

Challenges Faced:
Understanding when to use private and protected attributes.
Accessing private attributes within the class.

What I Learned:
How encapsulation helps in data security.
The difference between private (__) and protected (_) attributes.

Bonus: Polymorphism
Created an Animal base class with a speak() method overridden by Dog and Cat.

Challenges Faced:
Understanding method overriding.
Ensuring each subclass provides its own implementation.

What I Learned:
How polymorphism allows flexibility in object behavior.
How method overriding works in inheritance.
